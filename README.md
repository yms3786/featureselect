# FeatureSelect
A software for feature selection and machine learning applications

This application has been developed in laboratory of systems biology and bioinformatics.

FeatureSelect selects subset of features using optimization algorithms in the first step,
and then uses of LIBSVM for machine learning functions. FeatureSelect automatically generates
different outputs as diagrams and tables and can be applied to various fields like biology, text mining,
network analysis, etc.

We developed it as open source, so every one can modify and add new capabilities for it.

README file (pdf file) describes how you can use FeatureSelect.
